# AR/VR Home Menu UI Design

In this project, I used **Figma** to design a **futuristic and user-friendly home menu interface** for AR/VR environments. The focus was on **spatial interaction**, **accessibility**, and **intuitive navigation** to ensure an immersive user experience.

The design reflects **modern aesthetics**, clean structure, and smooth functionalityâ€”perfectly tailored for **mixed-reality platforms**.
